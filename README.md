# WebCom Weekly Status Generator

In my position as a Web Communications Specialist for Home Depot, we have to create a weekly status report in markdown and post to a Trello board. As time has gone on, the status report has gotten larger and more difficult to keep track of.

I built this app as a way to stay fresh with JavaScript as well as a way to help my team with their weekly updates. Since this will probably only be seen and used by my team, I have used minimal CSS. I may update CSS later.
